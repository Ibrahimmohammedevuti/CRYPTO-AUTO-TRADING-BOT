CHANGELOG V3

1. *Portfolio Diversification*:
   - modify the script to handle multiple trading pairs.
   - Instead of focusing on a single pair, the bot will scan and manage multiple pairs concurrently.

2. *Dynamic Allocation*:
   - I allocate capital dynamically based on the performance of each trading pair.
   - The bot will adjust the position size for each pair to optimize overall portfolio returns.

Remember to customize the trading pairs and adjust the position sizes based on your desired portfolio allocation. Happy diversified trading! ðŸš€ðŸ“ŠðŸŒŸ
